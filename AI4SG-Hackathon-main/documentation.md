# Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Statement
- **Problem Statement**: There is a need to address the lack of accessibility to students who struggle with full comprehension of the English language. This is a significant issue as it affects the academic performance of students and their ability to succeed in their studies. The problem is further exacerbated by the lack of resources available to students who require additional support.
- **Objectives**: A product that can accurately record and transcribe spoken English into text and then translate it into the desired language and furthermore read it back outloud.
- **Target Audience**: Students who struggle with English comprehension, students with hearing impairments or other disabilities.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution
- **Solution Overview**: Our solution is to develop an AI-powered educational platform that provides accurate translations of English speech to other languages. This platform will utilize natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to convert spoken English into text and then translate it into the desired language. This solution will not only help students who struggle with English comprehension, but also students with hearing impairments or other disabilities.
- **Key Features**: 
  - Accurate translation of English speech to other languages.
  - Conversion of spoken English into text.
  - Translation into the desired language.
  - Text-to-speech functionality.
- **Expected Impact**: With this program, students who struggle with English comprehension will have access to a tool that can help them understand the language better. This will improve their academic performance and overall learning experience. Additionally, students with hearing impairments or other disabilities will benefit from the text-to-speech functionality, making educational content more accessible to them.

### 1.3 Technical Aspects
- **Programming Languages**: Python for backend development, HTML CSS and JavaScript for frontend development.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: openai, deep_translator, playsound, speech_recognition
