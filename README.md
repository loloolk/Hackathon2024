#### Project Description:
Our project is a web application that uses machine learning to transcribe the detected audio, and can translate it into different languages. The application is designed to help people with hearing disabilities, and people who speak different languages communicate with each other. The application can also be used to transcribe audio from videos, and can be used to translate the audio from the video into different languages.

#### Quick Start:
To run this, start the API.py file with python, then open the Revere-main/index.html document
OR run the main.py file with python for the CLI Interface

NOTE: The reason all the commits were made by one person is because we used VSCode Live Share to make the entire project on one account
